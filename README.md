# Discord Bots
This is a per
sonal, fun project to create some discord bots. 

## Javascript Bot
I coded the Javascript bot. 
To run, use terminal and run `node DiscordBotJS.js`

This Bot responds to programed commands, using a prefix. 
Some of the responses are pulled from a list of responses. The list
is shuffled so that it doesn't just use the first response in the list
but a random response. It then takes that response that has been said, 
and puts it somewhere in the second half of the list, so that the bot 
does not say the same response twice in a row.
